# Cheatsets for Kapeli's Dash app

I highly recommend [Kapeli's Dash app](https://kapeli.com/dash).  In addition to a great resource for documentation, it allows us to create and share CheatSheets.

This is a library of Cheatsets I have created.  Cheatsets generate CheatSheets for Dash via the [cheatset gem](https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatset).  See that repo for more info.
