# Cheatsets for Kapeli's Dash app

I highly recommend [Kapeli's Dash app](https://kapeli.com/dash).  In addition to a great resource for documentation, it allows us to create and share CheatSheets.

This is a library of Cheatsets I have created.  These Cheatsets generate CheatSheets for Dash via the [cheatset gem](https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatset).

Cheatsheet:
- Generate a cheetsheet docset via: `$ cheatset generate puma-dev.rb`
- Install that (to only your local Dash) via: `$ open puma-dev.doscet`

See the [cheatset repo]((https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatset) and Dash's [Cheatsheet docs](https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatsheets#readme) for more.
